# AI-Predicting-Stock-Prices-2021
Ever since I saw the movie The Wolf of Wall Street, I was fascinated by it! So today, I have AI Predicting Stock Prices Python edition. Disclaimer:Â Now, Before we start, I want to say, as fascinating as AI predicting stock prices sounds, this is not financial advice in any shape or form. It will take the last 60 days of data and guess a single day into the future. If we tune it and modify it to be more sophisticated, it may predict the price more accurately. But as of now, this is just a proof of concept. Don't use this to make investment decisions.
